Hi I'm DasMonopol. My friends tend to call me Carlos though.

I'm an Animation & Game graduate from the University of Applied Sciences in Darmstadt.
My field of expertise is programming and I enjoy programming Gameplay, Front-End like UI and Effects but I'm also very interested in underlying Systems and Tools.

I am currently emplyed as a Software Developer at VetSoft.One in Hennef, Germany.
My main area of work is developing back-end functionality using the .NET Core framework for a Blazor web application.
