Hi I'm DasMonopol. My friends tend to call me Carlos though.

Currently I'm a student at the University of Applied Sciences in Darmstadt and I study Animation & Game.
My field of expertise is coding and I enjoy coding Gameplay, Front-End like UI and Effects but I'm also very interested in underlying Systems and Tools.
